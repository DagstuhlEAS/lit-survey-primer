<a id="goal" class="anchor" href="#goal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goal</h3>

<p>A literature survey is a systematic qualitative and/or quantitative analysis of publications in a particular field/discipline with the aim of understanding something about that field/discipline. There are many such studies, and this is intended to help make them relatively more comparable across sampling populations and over time.</p>

<p>This documents provides (1) steps on running a literature survey to asses the accessibility of code in an academic publication, and (2) examples and learnings from other such surveys. The steps can (and should) be amended, and the examples expanded.</p>

<p>This a living document that welcomes contributions, therefore it is hosted on GitHub. However, recognizing that not everyone who can make an important contribution is familiar with GitHub, please add any contributions or feedback <a href=https://github.com/DagstuhlEAS/lit-survey-primer/issues/new>as issues on the issue tracker!</a></p>




<!--  Inc. howison, the arizona study, Carverâ€™s security study. 

somewhat similar to this, the UK SSI did a survey of UK researchers to understand their reliance on software, their development, and their training: http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2014-12-04-its-impossible-conduct-research-without-software-say-7-out-10-uk-researchers
I am going to do a similar survey in the US very soon. If others are interested, the SSI folks and I would be happy to work together so that these surveys use the same questions as much as possible and so that we can compare results across countries



Data v Code
Complex configurations?
Lab notebook model: copy paste via R. Not good for serialization and reproducibility. Jupyter Notebooks allows bundling into coherent units
(Problems in reproducibility may be kind of ok here)
Implications
Offer information to funding agencies
Relationship to how seriously data management or code management seriously
Example of journal publishing programs: http://www.ipol.im
Comparable studies: industrial software sizes vs. open-source software sizes, gartner, software improvement group

<ol>
<li>Identify a sample. Example: 3 different publications from 3 different publishers, for a defined period of time.

  <br>Key challenges:<ol><li>Articulate what contitutes code that "ought" to be made available.</li><li>Articulate how sample relates to broader literature, and how (and whether) the forthcoming findings can be generalized.</li><li>Document with precision the inclusion criterion.</li></ol>

</li>
<li>Categorize whether the code that ought to be available is.<br>The <a href=https://twitter.com/asclnet>@asclnet</a> approach consist of sending personal request emails for code access, and then categorizing by whether the code was (1) available without email, (2) available upon email, possibly with some coaching, and (3) no response / not available.<br>Other approaches include systematic (manual) coding (annotation) of the content, as well as automated content analysis. Howison and Bullard, for example, have made the code for their ML approach available: <a href=https://github.com/jameshowison/softcite/>gh/softcite</a>.<br><small>Howison, James, and Julia Bullard. <a href=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23538/abstract

</li>
</ol>

Questions to answer in designing - and reporting - your survey, along with initial recommendations of materials to include, marked "M#," which can be used as a guidance checklist.

<ol>
  <li>What is the <strong>goal</strong> of the study? What are the findgins expected to inform?</li>
  <li>What are the <strong>inclusion criteria</strong>? To answer, consider including:<br>
    <strong>(M1)</strong> a general statement on what to include ("articles that name self-build software in the abstract")<br>
    <strong>(M2)</strong> one or two positive exaples of what was included and why<br>
    <strong>(M3)</strong> one or two negative examples of what was included and why (an article that does not mention the software they built until the interoduction. Note that the benefit to doing a <strong>quick pilot survey of just a handful of papers</strong> can help improve the inclusion criterion to be both more precise and inclusive of the right things.</li>
  <li>What is the **follow-up / engagement protocol**? If the literature survey includes reaching out to the authors, conssider including:<br>
    <strong>(M4)</strong> Text of the initial-contact email, followed by the rest of the exchange and any additional comments, such as getting a sense of densiveness that prompts a change in tone in subsequent follow-ups<br>
    <strong>(M5)</strong> The interview protocol, if there are stuctured or semi-structured interviews either remotely or in person.</li>

  <li>What is the <trong>coding scheme</strong>? If the literature urvey includes systematically going through the text of the publication, consider including:<br>
    <strong>(M6)</strong> Means for assessing reliability (whether formal inter-rater reliability metrics or otherwise) if multiple people are contributing to reading<br>
    <strong>(M7)</strong> Short (one sentence) definitions of every code with a positive and a negative example for application.</li>
  <li>How does the research object/artefact under scrutiny in the study (code) relate to other objects in this field (data, documentation of others' code)? Consider including:
    <strong>(M8)</strong> Short qualitative "memos" of surprises encountered on this subject.</li>
</ol>
