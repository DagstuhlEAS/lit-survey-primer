<p>A literature survey is a systematic qualitative and/or quantitative analysis of publications in a particular field/discipline with the aim of understanding something about that field/discipline. There are many such studies, and this is intended to help make them relatively more comparable across sampling populations and over time.</p>

<p>This documents provides (1) steps on running a literature survey to asses the accessibility of code in an academic publication, and (2) examples and learnings from other such surveys. The steps can (and should) be amended, and the examples expanded.</p>

<p>This a living document that welcomes contributions, therefore it is hosted on GitHub. However, recognizing that not everyone who can make an important contribution is familiar with GitHub, please add any contributions as comments on this issue [LINK TBA]</p>

<!--  Inc. howison, the arizona study, Carverâ€™s security study. 

somewhat similar to this, the UK SSI did a survey of UK researchers to understand their reliance on software, their development, and their training: http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2014-12-04-its-impossible-conduct-research-without-software-say-7-out-10-uk-researchers
I am going to do a similar survey in the US very soon. If others are interested, the SSI folks and I would be happy to work together so that these surveys use the same questions as much as possible and so that we can compare results across countries

Data v Code
Complex configurations?
Lab notebook model: copy paste via R. Not good for serialization and reproducibility. Jupyter Notebooks allows bundling into coherent units
(Problems in reproducibility may be kind of ok here)
Implications
Offer information to funding agencies
Relationship to how seriously data management or code management seriously
Example of journal publishing programs: http://www.ipol.im
Comparable studies: industrial software sizes vs. open-source software sizes, gartner, software improvement group

<ol>
<li>Identify a sample. Example: 3 different publications from 3 different publishers, for a defined period of time.

  <br>Key challenges:<ol><li>Articulate what contitutes code that "ought" to be made available.</li><li>Articulate how sample relates to broader literature, and how (and whether) the forthcoming findings can be generalized.</li><li>Document with precision the inclusion criterion.</li></ol>

</li>
<li>Categorize whether the code that ought to be available is.<br>The <a href=https://twitter.com/asclnet>@asclnet</a> approach consist of sending personal request emails for code access, and then categorizing by whether the code was (1) available without email, (2) available upon email, possibly with some coaching, and (3) no response / not available.
</li>
</ol>
